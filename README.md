# WordPress ThemeBuilder

A simple WordPress theme used for building other themes.

Basic functionality and structural styling are already included, giving you a head start on building your theme. For example, if you forget to style the comments in your theme, no biggie: the comments already look okayish. Or if you want to customize the comments, they're stripped-down enough that you won't have to fight against established styles.

Much of the styling and functionality was built with [Insight Designs'](http://insightdesigns.com) typical client in mind.

## Disclaimer

This theme is not being actively maintained. It was created in September 2012 and only tested with WP 3.4. Also, it's not responsive, although I wish it was.
